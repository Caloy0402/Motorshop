# SSE Staff Status System - Fixes and Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

The original SSE endpoint had several critical problems that prevented it from working:

### 1. **Missing Connection Management**
- No proper connection timeout handling
- No keep-alive messages (browsers expect these)
- No client disconnection detection

### 2. **Poor Error Handling**
- Database errors could crash the script
- No proper exception handling
- Missing error logging

### 3. **Output Buffering Issues**
- Improper output buffering control
- Could cause SSE events to not be sent immediately

### 4. **Resource Management**
- No proper cleanup on script termination
- Database connections not properly closed
- Memory leaks from infinite loops

## Files Modified

### 1. `sse_staff_status.php` (Fixed)
- Added proper SSE headers including `Connection: keep-alive`
- Implemented connection timeout (5 minutes)
- Added keep-alive messages every 30 seconds
- Added client disconnection detection
- Proper error handling and logging
- Clean resource management

### 2. `Admin-StaffLogs.php` (Enhanced)
- Added SSE client-side implementation
- Real-time staff status notifications
- Proper connection management and error handling
- Clean up on page unload

### 3. `test_sse_staff_status.php` (New)
- Test page for SSE connection
- Tests both production and debug endpoints
- Real-time event logging
- Connection status monitoring

### 4. `debug_sse_staff_status.php` (New)
- Debug version with detailed logging
- Writes to `debug_sse_log.txt` file
- Shows exactly what's happening in the SSE endpoint

### 5. `test_database_connection.php` (New)
- Tests database connectivity
- Verifies table structure
- Checks for required data

## How to Test

### Step 1: Test Database Connection
1. Navigate to `Admin-StaffLogs.php`
2. Click the "Test DB" button
3. Verify all tests pass (green checkmarks)
4. If any errors, fix database issues first

### Step 2: Test SSE Connection
1. Click the "Test SSE" button
2. Click "Test SSE Connection" to test production endpoint
3. Click "Test Debug SSE" to test debug endpoint
4. Monitor the event log for real-time messages

### Step 3: Test Real-time Updates
1. Open `Admin-StaffLogs.php` in one tab
2. Open `test_real_time.php` in another tab
3. Simulate staff login/logout in the test page
4. Watch for real-time notifications in the Staff Logs page

## Expected Behavior

### When Working Correctly:
- SSE connection establishes immediately
- Keep-alive messages every 30 seconds
- Real-time notifications for staff status changes
- Automatic reconnection on errors
- Clean disconnection when page is closed

### Debug Information:
- Check browser console for connection logs
- Check `debug_sse_log.txt` for server-side logs
- Monitor network tab for SSE connection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Connection failed" error**
   - Check if database is accessible
   - Verify `staff_logs` table exists
   - Check PHP error logs

2. **No events received**
   - Verify SSE endpoint is accessible
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure no output before SSE headers

3. **Connection drops immediately**
   - Check for PHP errors in the SSE script
   - Verify database connection
   - Check for output buffering issues

### Debug Steps:

1. Use the debug endpoint (`debug_sse_staff_status.php`)
2. Check the debug log file (`debug_sse_log.txt`)
3. Monitor browser network tab
4. Check PHP error logs
5. Verify database connectivity

## Technical Details

### SSE Headers Required:
```
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### Event Format:
```
data: {"type":"staff_status_change","staff_name":"John Doe","role":"Cashier","status":"Online"}

: keep-alive

```

### Connection Lifecycle:
1. Client connects â†’ `onopen` event
2. Server sends initial message
3. Keep-alive every 30 seconds
4. Status change events as they occur
5. Connection timeout after 5 minutes
6. Clean disconnection

## Performance Considerations

- SSE connection uses minimal resources
- Database queries every 3 seconds
- Automatic cleanup on disconnection
- Connection pooling not needed (one per client)

## Security Notes

- SSE endpoint requires admin session
- Database queries use prepared statements
- No sensitive data exposed in events
- Proper session validation

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication to SSE endpoint
- Implement event filtering
- Add connection pooling for multiple clients
- Implement event queuing for offline clients
